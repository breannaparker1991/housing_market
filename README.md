Right now, with so many issues there are with buying homes and property, this can affect businesses as well. Any business that wants to buy a home and rezone it (which has been the case for cafes, etc), or for companies that buy homes to rent them out, or just for people who want to buy a home so that they can work from home in their own business with plenty of space. The increase of homes available affects everyone. Here we will be looking at the changes in the housing market, and seeing if we can find out what the best course of action is and if things will change in the future. The first dataset found is from the redfin website and goes over the housing sales prices, listing numbers, etc over the last decade. More data will probably be needed to get the full scope of what is currently happening on the marketplace. Overall analysis of the data collected shows that prices of homes have increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, but also that the number of homes available has hugely decreased. As long as therer aren't very many homes, they'll continue to get bought up quickly, at prices way above asking, causing even fewer people and businesses the ability to buy homes.
